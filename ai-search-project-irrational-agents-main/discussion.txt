Discussion Log: 
We briefly discussed possible ideas for heuristics with Kyle, Tristan, and Seanâ€™s group. We also talked about some common bugs that we had, such as our block moving over obstacles. We both ended up fixing these issues on our own, though. 
Aside from this, we did not discuss the project with anyone.
